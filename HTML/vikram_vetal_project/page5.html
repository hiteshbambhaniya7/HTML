        Vikram Betal Story 5: Who are husband and wife (पति पत्नी कौन)?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time there lived a King in Dharmpur . The king had built a grand temple in Dharmpur. Few days later, a young man visited Dharmpur. The man was mesmerized with the grandeur of the temple. On the stairs of the temple, he spotted a beautiful young girl and fell in love with her. The girl was washer-man’s daughter. The young man immediately started praying to the Goddess of the temple to grant him the wish to get married to the girl. The girl had also liked the young man. So, finally they came together.

        After some time, the same young man along with his wife and friend again visited Dharmpur.  The young man thought of visiting the temple. He left his wife and friend under the tree and went ahead to visit the temple. Unfortunately, the young man’s fell from the stairs of the temple and died. Few hours later, his friend came to search him. Discovering that his dearest friend is no more he also gave up his life. When the wife came to know about the death of her husband and her husband’s friend, her grief knew no bound.

        She started crying loudly. Listening to her painful cries the Goddess of the temple presented herself to the girl. The Goddess gave her a sacred syllable to resurrect her husband and her husband’s friend. However, the girl uttered the syllable wrong and such happened that her husband’s body exchanged with her husband’s friend mind and same thing happened to the other person.

        “Can you tell Vikram who should be considered as the real husband of the girl?” asked Betal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vikram replied “The Body which has mind of the girl’s husband should be considered as the real husband of the gir, as we are what our mind is.”

        Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk.
