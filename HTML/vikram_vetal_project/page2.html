        Vikram Betal Story 2: Who's the husband (पति कौन हुआ)?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time there lived a man name Keshav near the banks of river Yamuna. Keshav was searching for a groom for her daughter – Madhumati. In this quest, such happened that, Madhumati’s father, brother and mother found three different grooms according to their choice respectively. But before the decision could be made, a venomous snake bit Madhumati because of which she died.  After this accident, the first lad took the belonging of Madhumati and went back to his home with Madhumati’s mementos. The second boy started living there only where Madhumati lost her life as if he is living along with him. The third boy left the village and learned a mystic art of bringing back dead to life.

        Now the third boy used his newly learned art and brought Madhumati back to life. As soon as Madhumati resurrected, the first question was – whom should Madhumati marry?
    </p>
    <p>
        Betal asked – “Can you tell Vikram who is the rightful husband of Madhumati?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Vikram replied – “The boy who took Madhumati’s belongings as memento will be considered as his son. The boy who brought Madhumati back to life will be considered as her father. The boy who started living at the place where Madhumati demised, as if she is alive is the rightful husband of Madhumati.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk.
