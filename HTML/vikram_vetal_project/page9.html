        “Can you tell Vikram, why did the thief first laugh and then cry?” Asked betal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vikram replied “ The thief first laughed because he pitied on such a nice girl for falling in love with a crook, the thief then cried because he thought that had such a nice girl came into his life earlier, why would he walked this walk to execution.”
