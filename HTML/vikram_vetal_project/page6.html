    <h1>Vikram Betal Story 6: Whose favor is greater (किसका उपकार बड़ा)?</h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time there lived a young boy named Chiramdev in Mithilavati. Chirmdev wanted to serve in royal court of Mithilavati, buthe was not getting an opportunity to enter the royal court. Once such happened that King of Mithilavati – Gunadhip went for hunting in jungle and lost his way. Coincidentally, Chiramdev found the King and he saved the King’s life. The King appointed Chiramdev as his guard.

        Few days later, Chirmadev went to the sea shore. There he saw a temple. He thought of visiting the sacred place. On the stairs of the temple he spotted a beautiful girl. Chiramdev fell in love with that girl. The girl asked Chiramdev to go and take holy dip in the temple pond. As soon as Chiramdev dipped in the pond, he found himself back to the Mithilavati. Chiramdev  told the entire story to the King. The King agreed to help Chiramdev and went to the same temple near the sea-shore. They spotted the same girl there. However, this time the girl fell in love with the King. But the King asked girl to marry Chiramdev instead.

        “Can you tell Vikram, whose favor is bigger, Gunadhip or Chiramdev?” Asked Betal
    </p>
    <p>
        Vikram replied  “Gundhip’s favor is bigger as he was not obliged to sacrifice for chiramdev, but he did it out of affection.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk.
