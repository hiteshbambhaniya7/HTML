        Vikram Betal Story 10: Who is the intelligent one?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time, there lived a Brahmin named – Govind in Dharmpur. Govind had two sons – Hatidatt and Somdatt. One such happened that Govind required a tortoise to perform a ritual. The ritual was being performed to invite wealth and prosperity. So both the sons started fighting to bring tortoise. Finally the matter reached royal court. The King decided to know the talent of both the sons of Govind and then arrive on some conclusion.

    <p>
        The first son claimed that he can smell and tell the place from where the food has come.
    </p>
    <p>
        The King ordered his chef to bring some food from kitchen. The first son smelled it and told that the grains had been sown in a field near royal palace. His claim was verified by the chef. The king was amazed.

        Now the King turned to the second son. Second son claimed that he can tell inspect the bed and tell whether it can used for sleeping or not.

    <p>
        The King ordered his servant to bring a bed. The second son of Govind inspected it and told that the seventh layer of this bed has a thorn which makes this bed unfit for sleeping.

    <p>
        The King was again amazed. The King could not decide anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Can you tell Vikram who is the intelligent one among both of them?” Asked Betal
    </p>
    <p>
        Vikram did not know the answer for the first time. Beta, happy with Vikram’s honesty agrees to go along with Vikram.
