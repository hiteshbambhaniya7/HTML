    </h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time, there lived a person named – Haridas in Ujjain. Haridas was searching for a suitable groom for his daughter – Mahadevi. The daughter had only demanded a courageous groom for herself. One day Haridas met with a boy who was expert in building such chariot which were capable of reaching anywhere in almost no time. Haridas thought he has found a suitable groom for his daughter. The problem arose when he reached home and came to know that his wife and son have also selected two grooms for Mahadevi respectively.

        Before the matter was settled, Mahadevi was abducted by a demon. The boy who was selected by the Haridas’s son had a secret power using which he found the location of Mahadevi. After that, the boy who was selected by Haridas, used his magical chariot to reach the place immediately, where the Mahadevi was kept. And finally, the boy who was selected by Mahadevi’s mother fought with the demon and set Mahadevi free.

        “Can you tell Vikram who is the most suitable groom for Mahadevi?” asked Betal
    </p>
    <p>
        Vikram replied “Mahadevi wanted a courageous boy. So the one who fought for Mahadevi and set her free, is the most suitable groom for her. “

        Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk.
