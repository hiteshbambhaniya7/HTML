    <h1>Vikram Betal Story 8: Who is the most educated ?</h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time there lived four siblings in a village. Once they decided to go and learn the art of resurrection from a learned master. After completing their learning they were returning back to their village, and then they saw a dead lion on their way. The siblings decided to showcase what they had learned. However, the fourth and the youngest brother begged to differ.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first and the eldest brother arranged the bones of the Lion. The second brother covered the bones of lion with skin. As soon as third one was about to resurrect the lion, the fourth brother tried to stop him, but no one listened to him. So the fourth brother climbed the tree. As soon as the third brother spelled a sacred chant to resurrect the Lion, the Lion came back to life and ate all three brothers.

        “So tell me Vikram, who was the most educated of all the three siblings?” Asked Betal
    </p>
    <p>
        Vikram replied “The one who tried to stop all the three brothers. As he had a common sense to examine the consequences, while other three brothers lacked the common sense to envision the consequences of their action.”

        Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk.
