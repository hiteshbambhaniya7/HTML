        Vikram Betal Story 3: Whose sacrifice is bigger (किसका त्याग बड़ा)?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time, there lived a King named – Roopsen, who ruled Burdwaan Kingdom. Once, a young man – Birbar,  approached the King for employment.  The King appointed Birbar as his personal guard. King Roopsen compensated Birbar well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Few days later, The King Roopsen heard a lady crying bitterly in a field nearby. Roopsen ordered Birbar to go and inquire the matter. Along with ordering Birbar, Roopsen himself followed Birbar secretly. Birbar realized that the lady was an omen who is warning the King about an upcoming danger on his life. When Birbar asked some remedy to avert this danger, the lady told that there is a temple nearby. If Birbar relinquish everything and serve the temple, The King’s life will be spared.

    <p>
        Listening to this, Birbar left his home and started serving the temple along with his family. However, the conditions in temple were quite harsh. Birbar and his family couldn’t survive in temple and died eventually. When the King came to know about this, he became hopeless. In grief and despair, he decided to kill himself.  Suddenly, Goddess of the temple appeared before King and blessed him for being pure in heart. The King requested goddess to resurrect Birbar and his family and Lo! The family was resurrected.

        Now, Betal asked  “Birbar sacrificed himself and his family, The King was also about to sacrifice himself, but still if you have to choose one, then whose sacrifice is bigger?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Vikram replied “ I believe that King’s sacrifice is bigger as Birbar was obliged to protect the King, but King was not obliged to protect the Birbar, still out of affection, the King decided to sacrifice his life.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Hearing the correct answer, Betal fled back to the tree trunk.
